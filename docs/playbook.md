# NeuroJazz Playbook

## 1. Core Principles
- Capture > Organize > Synthesize.
- Never break flow for structure during capture.
- Use stubs when full thoughts can't be finished.

---

## 2. Getting Started
- Open ChatGPT (or similar AI tool).
- Begin a free-flow journaling session.
- Add timestamps (optional but recommended).
- Use [Tag Examples](#tags) to mark important ideas.

---

## 3. Tags & Visual Coding
Color coding is optional and depends on your tool (Markdown alone doesn’t support colors).  
Here are two simple ways to add visual cues:

### **Emoji Method (Works Everywhere)**
- 🔵 **Executive Function Insight** — e.g., “🔵 Idea for reducing morning EF load”
- 🟢 **Somatic Note** — e.g., “🟢 Shoulder tension eased after hydration”
- 🟣 **Creative Idea** — e.g., “🟣 Possible research angle: THC + ADHD mindfulness”

### **HTML Color (For GitHub Pages / Advanced Users)**
*(May not render in raw GitHub Markdown view, but works on GitHub Pages and some editors):*
```html
<span style="color:blue;">[EF] Executive Function Insight</span><br>
<span style="color:green;">[GI] Somatic Note</span><br>
<span style="color:purple;">[Idea] Creative Idea</span>
```
- **[EF]** Executive function insight
- **[GI]** Body awareness or GI tracking
- **[Idea]** Creative concept stub
- **[Mood]** Emotional note
- Customize tags per session.

---

## 4. Adding Physiological Data (Optional)
- Pull Oura data with [fetch_oura_data.py] (future repo section).
- Merge sleep/readiness summaries into your daily log.

---

## 5. After the Session
- Export or copy logs into Markdown.
- Sort into:
  - `/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - `/case-study` for longform insights
  - `/research-threads` for future questions.

---

## 6. Why This Works
- Reduces anxiety from lost thoughts.
- Externalizes executive function load.
- Turns chaotic streams into usable structure.
