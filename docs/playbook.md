## 1. Core Principles
- Capture > Organize > Synthesize.
- Never break flow for structure during capture.
- Use stubs when full thoughts can't be finished.

---

## 2. Getting Started
- Open ChatGPT (or similar AI tool).
- Begin a free-flow journaling session.
- Add timestamps (optional but recommended).
- Use [Tag Examples](#tags) to mark important ideas.

---

## 3. Tags & Color Coding
- **[EF]** Executive function insight
- **[GI]** Body awareness or GI tracking
- **[Idea]** Creative concept stub
- **[Mood]** Emotional note
- Customize tags per session.

---

## 4. Adding Physiological Data (Optional)
- Pull Oura data with [fetch_oura_data.py] (future repo section).
- Merge sleep/readiness summaries into your daily log.

---

## 5. After the Session
- Export or copy logs into Markdown.
- Sort into:
  - `/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - `/case-study` for longform insights
  - `/research-threads` for future questions.

---

## 6. Why This Works
- Reduces anxiety from lost thoughts.
- Externalizes executive function load.
- Turns chaotic streams into usable structure.
