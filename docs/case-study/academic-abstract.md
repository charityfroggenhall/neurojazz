## Title
NeuroJazz: AI-Augmented Journaling as a Cognitive Support for ADHD Brains

**Author:** Charity Froggenhall

**Abstract:**
Late-diagnosed adults with ADHD often struggle with executive function (EF), working memory, and cognitive load management. Traditional journaling can help externalize thoughts, but high-friction workflows and perfectionism frequently undermine consistency—especially when ideas are fleeting. This case study explores an N=1 experiment leveraging ChatGPT as a dynamic journaling and meta-analysis tool, designed to capture spontaneous thought flows, organize them into structured “waves,” and generate actionable EF transfer strategies.

**Objective:**
To determine whether AI-assisted journaling improves:
- Spontaneous idea capture.
- Reduction of task paralysis via structured review.
- Awareness of cognitive and behavioral patterns (e.g., impulsivity, mindfulness).

**Method:**
- Daily and event-based logging in Markdown with AI as a real-time partner.
- Use of “stub capture” for incomplete thoughts to preserve cognitive continuity.
- Wave-mapping for tagging thematic flows across sessions.
- EF Transfer Maps to convert session insights into real-world strategies.
- Analysis of secondary variables: medication timing, THC effects, hormonal context.

**Findings (Observed):**
- AI-enabled context retention reduced loss of ideas from early termination of thoughts.
- Spontaneous externalization improved perceived self-trust and working memory confidence.
- Journaling evolved from symptom logging to a cognitive design framework integrating mindfulness principles.

**Implications:**
AI journaling platforms can serve as cognitive prosthetics for ADHD brains by:
- Preserving the integrity of incomplete thoughts (stub recovery).
- Reducing working memory demands.
- Providing low-friction meta-analysis without format disruption.

**Research Questions:**
- Can AI-assisted journaling replicate mindfulness effects for ADHD individuals?
- Does context-retentive AI improve EF more than static journaling?
- What is the role of hormonal states and GLP-1 medications in EF optimization when paired with AI?


## Future Design Considerations
Prosody-aware AI could strengthen cognitive journaling by identifying state markers (e.g., anxiety or fatigue) through tone and speech rate. To be ethical, this must be built with consent-first principles and zero-retention audio processing.
