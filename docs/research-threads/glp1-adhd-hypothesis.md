# GLP-1 & ADHD Hypothesis

Can Zepbound itself help patients who also have ADHD with cognitive impulsivity?  
A worthy topic for research!

## Why It Matters
- GLP-1 drugs reduce appetite and impulsive eating. Could similar pathways affect cognitive impulsivity?
- Potential overlap with ADHD executive function challenges.
- If true, implications for both treatment planning and clinical research.

### Next Steps
- Collect anecdotal reports from ADHD + GLP-1 users.
- Look for existing literature on GLP-1 receptor agonists and neurocognitive outcomes.
