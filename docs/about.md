# About NeuroJazz

**NeuroJazz** is an AI-assisted journaling framework designed for ADHD minds.  
It began as a simple THC effect tracker and grew into a structured method for:

- Capturing fleeting thoughts without breaking flow
- Reducing cognitive load through real-time synthesis
- Linking subjective experiences with physiological data (e.g., Oura)
- Providing research-ready structures for executive function, mindfulness, and neurodivergence

## Why This Matters
ADHD is not a deficit of attention—it’s difficulty directing attention at the right things at the right time.  
Traditional journaling tools often fail ADHD brains because:
- Blank pages demand perfection
- Switching apps destroys working memory
- Raw dumps create chaos without synthesis

**NeuroJazz changes that** by using ChatGPT as a live cognitive partner.
