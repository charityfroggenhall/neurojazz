# EF Transfer Map Example

This is an example of how an **Executive Function Transfer Map** might work in practice.  
The goal is to show how a concept discovered during a journaling session moves into applied contexts.

## Original Insight (Stub Capture)
"Stopping to write down a stub mid-idea helps me re-enter the thought later without losing flow."

---

## Transfer Path
- **Immediate Context:** Logging insight during journaling
- **Work Application:** Using stubs during Zoom meetings for non-disruptive idea capture
- **Tool Integration:** Recording stubs in ChatGPT → Exporting to Markdown → Adding to project docs

### Why It Matters
Executive function gains are transferable if mapped from origin (spontaneous insight) to future use cases. This section will later include a diagram template for mapping EF wins.
