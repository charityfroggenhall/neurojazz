## Title
From Gummy Logs to Cognitive Scaffolds: How AI Became My ADHD Co-Pilot

**By:** Charity Froggenhall

**Introduction:**
When I started this project, I just wanted to track weed gummies. Some made me feel focused instead of foggy, and I wanted to know why. My plan? Build a THC database—dosages, strains, effects. Simple enough.

Then something happened: The journaling process became as interesting as the data. Capturing thought flows during sessions revealed how ADHD really works in my brain—why ideas vanish unless I catch them instantly. And that’s where ChatGPT changed everything.

**What Changed:**
Instead of scattered notes, I had a partner that:
- Let me capture stubs without losing context.
- Turned chaos into a structured “wave log.”
- Helped me build an EF Transfer Map to apply insights later.

This wasn’t just about cannabis anymore. It became a framework for executive function, mindfulness, and trust repair—powered by a tool that never blinks when I hit Enter too soon.

**Why ChatGPT Matters:**
ADHD journaling usually fails because friction kills spontaneity. Blank pages demand polish. Thoughts evaporate in seconds. With ChatGPT:
- I could externalize without breaking flow.
- AI filled in missing intent from stubs using session context.
- Multi-day continuity emerged—something my working memory alone could never hold.

**Impact:**
- Improved confidence in thought retrieval.
- Reduced time-blindness by making abstract patterns visible.
- Integration of mindfulness principles without triggering “sit still” aversion.

**Biggest Surprise:**
I didn’t plan this. It started as curiosity, became an experiment, and evolved into what I now call NeuroJazz: a cognitive improvisation system for ADHD minds.

**Future Directions:**
This case raises research questions:
- Could AI journaling tools serve as therapeutic aids?
- How does combining THC journaling, mindfulness, and AI reshape EF strategies?
- Could GLP-1 medications (e.g., ZepBound) amplify these effects?

## Future Design Considerations
Prosody-aware AI could strengthen cognitive journaling by identifying state markers (e.g., anxiety or fatigue) through tone and speech rate. To be ethical, this must be built with consent-first principles and zero-retention audio processing.
