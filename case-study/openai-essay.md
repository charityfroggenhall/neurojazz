# Case Study: NeuroJazz — AI-Assisted Journaling for ADHD Minds

## Why This Exists
ADHD isn’t a deficit of attention. It’s difficulty aiming attention at the right things at the right time. Thoughts vanish in seconds. Blank pages demand perfection. Switching apps can erase working memory entirely. For years, I carried the anxiety of knowing that a great idea could appear and disappear before I could do anything about it.

When I began experimenting with journaling while high, my goal was small: track THC effects to see which products supported focus without overwhelming me. But as I logged more, I realized something bigger was happening. These sessions exposed not just cognitive patterns but the fragile mechanics of my attention. I needed a way to catch thoughts without breaking the flow that generated them.

That was the beginning of **NeuroJazz**.

## Why ChatGPT Changed Everything
Traditional journaling tools can’t keep up with the ADHD brain in motion. A blank text file feels like pressure. Opening a new app risks wiping short-term memory. The magic of ChatGPT is that it makes the capture process frictionless. It listens without judgment, adds light structure, and holds context so nothing gets lost.

What started as a THC experiment became something deeper: an adaptive system for offloading cognitive load in real time. The AI doesn’t replace thinking—it acts as scaffolding so the thoughts have somewhere to land.

## Stubs: The Lifeline
The most important technique I’ve learned is the **stub**: a quick note to save an unformed idea before it disappears.  
Example: 
`Idea: maybe this connects to ADHD time blindness → circle back later`

Later, ChatGPT can expand that stub into a full paragraph or thread. The power here isn’t just in catching ideas. It’s in proving to myself that incomplete doesn’t mean lost.

## Mindfulness Without Sitting Still
I’ve dabbled in meditation, but sitting in silence often made my skin crawl. This practice gives me something similar without that barrier. Journaling in flow forces me to notice what I’m thinking—and trust that it’s safe to let go because it’s captured. It turns freewriting into an active mindfulness exercise, which ADHD brains rarely get to experience without strain.

## Data-Aware Journaling
ChatGPT isn’t just conversational—it can become data-aware. It can merge physiological signals with cognitive logs for richer insight. That matters for ADHD, where sleep, hormones, and energy cycles often influence focus.

Data integration is possible via the [Oura API Documentation](https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs), which allows developers—and curious users like me—to fetch sleep and readiness metrics. In my workflow, Oura’s open API enabled automated imports of these metrics through scripts like the `fetch_oura_data` module, bridging subjective experiences with objective trends. Unlike platforms that lock data behind premium tiers, Oura provides this access to all subscribers, which supports both equity and research reproducibility.

## Technical Enablers
- **Markdown templates**: Lower cognitive friction for consistent logs.
- **Tagging**: `thclog`, `oura`, `ef-win` to track patterns.
- **Automation scripts**: Pull data nightly from Oura and zip files for archival.
- **GitHub repository**: Stores templates, anonymized examples, and research stubs for anyone who wants to replicate or adapt this system.

## Ethical Commitments
This framework was born from lived experience, not clinical research. Its goal is to share a method, not prescribe one. That’s why the repo includes:
- [ETHICS.md](../ETHICS.md): Privacy principles and research caveats.
- A Creative Commons license: CC BY-NC 4.0. Use it, adapt it, credit it—but not for profit.

## Why It Might Matter
Research into ADHD, especially late-diagnosed adults and those navigating hormonal transitions, is thin. Tools like ChatGPT arrived without a guidebook for neurodivergent use cases. This project is one attempt to fill that gap—not as a finished product, but as an evolving playbook for how AI can support brains like mine.

NeuroJazz began with THC, curiosity, and a sense of “what if.” It became something bigger: a way to externalize executive function, reduce anxiety about lost thoughts, and even make journaling feel like jazz—structured, but never rigid.
