# How a Weed Gummy Log Turned Into a Cognitive Framework
*by Charity Froggenhall*

### I didn’t set out to build a system. I just wanted to track gummies.
Some cannabis edibles left me foggy, others felt paradoxically calming, almost focused. As someone diagnosed with ADHD in midlife, I wanted to understand why. My plan was simple: log THC products, doses, and effects to find patterns.

That was all it was supposed to be, a personal database experiment.

### Then something unexpected happened.
I started noticing that the act of writing during those sessions, the stream-of-consciousness note-taking, felt valuable beyond the gummy analysis. It wasn’t just recording effects, it was capturing my mind in motion.

And that mattered, because ADHD isn’t just about distraction. In fact, “attention deficit” is a misnomer. It’s not a lack of attention, **it’s difficulty aiming attention at the right things at the right time.** Thoughts crowd in, but you can’t always hold onto the ones that matter. That fear of losing them drives anxiety. For me, that anxiety was a constant background hum.

Logging in ChatGPT gave me something I’d never had before:
**a cognitive safety net.**

Every stray thought had a place to land without breaking the flow. If I typed a fragment and hit Enter too soon, AI could recover my intent from context. That ability to save the stub was a breakthrough, not just for note-taking, but for trust in my own brain.

### The backstory that makes this hit hard.
I was the “gifted” kid, the one reading ahead before first grade. My mom even wondered if I should start later because I seemed “immature.” But in the late ’70s, no one had language for ADHD in girls. All the research then centered on white, hyperactive 7-year-old boys.

So I grew up thinking I was smart but flaky, lazy, or careless. Decades later, during the 2020 pandemic, the coping structures I’d built collapsed. Remote work magnified every crack. That’s when I sought diagnosis at 48.

I’m not alone. Millions of late-diagnosed women and AFAB individuals share this story. Research still lags far behind our lived reality.

### So what does journaling have to do with it?
Everything.

Traditional journaling is high-friction for ADHD brains. Blank pages demand perfection, and thoughts slip away in seconds. Even something as simple as opening a new notebook page, a browser tab, or an app can reset working memory and wipe out the thread you were trying to hold.

This method changes that because the act of journaling becomes a kind of mindfulness practice. It focuses the mind on the present thought without the anxiety of losing it, because once written, it’s safe.

Sure, you could open a voice memo or dump words into a notes app, but that only captures the noise. What makes this different is ChatGPT’s ability to **synthesize and index** those streams, turning raw thoughts into something navigable and meaningful. This isn’t a three-hour audio file you’ll never revisit. It’s a system that shapes chaos into structure without breaking the flow.

The brilliance of this AI-assisted approach isn’t that it makes journaling easier, it makes it possible by:
- Catching fragments (stub rescue)
- Preserving continuity across days (wave mapping)
- Turning chaotic dumps into actionable patterns (EF Transfer Maps)

What started as “track gummies” became **NeuroJazz**, a method for improvising with your own mind, building cognitive scaffolding without breaking spontaneity.

### As this grew and deepened, I asked: is this useful beyond me?
I’m not a researcher. But I’ve spent enough time in ADHD forums and work support chats to know I’m not the only one struggling with lost thoughts, mental load anxiety, and the gap between knowing what helps and actually doing it.

All these insights were living inside ChatGPT, a walled garden. They helped me, but no one else. ChatGPT can save these insights in memory, but the system won't train on what I've added and upload them to a "Borg" consciousness to share. And unless this work leaves that box, it disappears when the session ends.

That’s why I built the GitHub repo.
That’s why I’m writing this.

### What makes this different?
- It’s real-world tested, not theoretical. Built in the mess of everyday life, not a lab.
- It’s ethics-first: privacy, consent, no “move fast and break things.”
- It’s open: licensed for non-commercial use, because community matters more than profit.
- And it’s iterative by design: the repo shows the evolution from raw logs to structured frameworks.

ChatGPT isn’t just conversational—it’s data-aware. It can integrate physiological signals with cognitive logs to create richer context for analysis. Data integration is possible via the [Oura API Documentation](https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs), which allows developers—and regular curious nerds like me—to fetch sleep and readiness metrics.

In my workflow, Oura’s open API enabled automated imports of these metrics through scripts like the fetch_oura_data module, bridging subjective experiences with objective trends. Unlike platforms that lock data behind premium tiers, Oura provides this access to all subscribers, which supports both equity and research reproducibility.

Other wearables, like Apple Watch, can add value, but lack of straightforward export without third-party tools creates friction. Even Oura’s built-in tagging system, while useful, requires manual steps and app switching—something ADHD brains are especially vulnerable to. Externalizing that complexity into automated scripts keeps the cognitive load low and preserves the flow.

### The policy gap that shapes this work
Research into THC’s potential benefits for ADHD is severely limited by federal restrictions in the U.S. Two converging forces made this project possible: legalization at the state level, which allows easy access to a wide range of products, and the rise of tools like ChatGPT that make structured, real-time journaling feasible. Without broader legalization and regulatory reform, these questions remain hard to answer.

Any meaningful research into THC and ADHD must go hand-in-hand with advocacy for legalization. Without it, we risk creating another closed loop where insights benefit only those with privilege or geographic access. Legalization isn’t just a policy debate—it’s a prerequisite for equitable research and informed care.

### Idle questions that won’t leave me alone:
- Could AI journaling reduce state anxiety for ADHD and anxious brains?
- Does externalizing thoughts in real time improve executive function long-term?
- Could tone or speech cadence predict cognitive strain, and if so, how do we study that without violating privacy?
- What happens when late-diagnosed ADHD adults get tools that actually fit their brains?

I don’t have those answers. But I know this:
if this helps one other person feel less broken, or sparks research into how we design tools for minds like mine, it’s worth sharing.
