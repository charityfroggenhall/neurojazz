# Ethics and Research Barriers
- Privacy and consent first: No personal identifiers beyond voluntary sharing.
- Open licensing for non-commercial use.
- No gatekeeping or monetization of mental health insights.

## Barriers to Research
- Federal prohibition of cannabis in the U.S. severely limits THC research, especially for ADHD populations.
- Current studies skew toward privileged users or clinical exceptions.

## Ethical Imperatives
- Research into THC and ADHD cannot be separated from advocacy for legalization.
- Without legalization, findings remain inaccessible and inequitable.
- Policy reform is necessary to ensure diverse participation and accurate data.

## Why This Repo Exists
- To create an open, anonymized case study showing how AI can support cognitive scaffolding for ADHD.
- To spark future research into AI-assisted journaling, executive function, and mental health.
