## Why NeuroJazz Exists

NeuroJazz started as an experiment: one ADHD brain trying to understand why some cannabis experiences seemed to improve focus and mindfulness instead of creating chaos. What began as a THC log grew into a full cognitive framework for executive function, built on journaling, reflection, and an AI partner that could hold context across time.

This is not about soulless optimization. It’s about curiosity, self-awareness, and scaffolding for neurodivergent minds. While this framework was designed for ADHD, its benefits may also apply to anyone experiencing anxiety or cognitive overload by reducing the mental strain of trying to remember everything.

**Privacy Note:** NeuroJazz currently captures text only. Future research may explore speech tone analysis for state detection, with strict privacy controls and zero audio retention.

## Ethics Statement
NeuroJazz prioritizes consent-first design and privacy in all current and future features. Any exploration of advanced capabilities (such as tone or prosody analysis) will follow strict principles: no long-term storage, user-controlled settings, and transparency by default.


## The Journey So Far
NeuroJazz began as a simple THC journaling experiment: track which gummies improved focus and mood. Over weeks of iterative logging and AI-assisted reflection, it evolved into a cognitive design framework for ADHD, anxiety, and executive function support. 

This project is both artifact and method: built using the same principles it advocates—spontaneity capture, stub rescue, iterative integration, and ethics-first transparency. What started as a personal curiosity now serves as a research-ready model for human-AI cognitive scaffolding.
