# ADHD Medication Patterns and Sleep

## Context
During journaling sessions, a recurring pattern emerged:
- Skipped stimulant doses (e.g., Adderall) due to concern about delayed sleep.
- Hyperfocus episodes causing missed med windows entirely.

This suggests a trade-off between maintaining cognitive function during the day and protecting nighttime sleep quality.

## Research Questions
- How do ADHD adults make real-time decisions about stimulant timing?
- What adaptive strategies (e.g., dynamic dose adjustment, AI-assisted reminders) could minimize sleep disruption without cognitive cost?
- Could AI journaling logs predict when a user is likely to skip a dose based on prior hyperfocus behaviors?

## Notes
This thread is exploratory. It highlights the gap between clinical guidelines (fixed schedules) and real-world neurodivergent behavior, where flexibility may improve both adherence and well-being.
