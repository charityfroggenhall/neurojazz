# Prosody-Based Cognitive Signal Analysis

## Concept
Future versions of NeuroJazz (or similar AI systems) could use prosody—tone, pitch, speech rate—as cognitive markers to detect changes in state such as anxiety spikes, THC onset, or executive function strain.

## Why It Matters
- Speech rate can correlate with cognitive load or overstimulation.
- Tone fluctuations may indicate anxiety or emotional intensity.
- Pauses and stumbles can suggest fatigue or attentional drift.

## Privacy-First Design Principles
- Audio should never be stored long-term.
- Analysis should happen in-memory with immediate deletion post-processing.
- Explicit user consent required; toggle feature on/off.

## Research Questions
- Could prosody metrics enhance real-time ADHD support?
- Can changes in cadence predict EF strain or THC effects?
- What ethical frameworks ensure safety and trust for users?
