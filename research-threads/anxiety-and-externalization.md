# Anxiety and Externalization

## Hypothesis
AI-assisted journaling may reduce anxiety by lowering cognitive uncertainty, particularly when anxiety is tied to fear of forgetting or losing information.

## Context
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder often co-occurs with ADHD.
- Anxiety symptoms can be amplified by ADHD-related executive dysfunction.
- Externalization of thoughts provides cognitive relief, reducing working memory load.

## Research Questions
- Does AI-assisted journaling reduce state anxiety during high cognitive load?
- Could this system benefit non-ADHD populations with anxiety disorders?
